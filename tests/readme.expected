{0 md2mld: Convert md files into odoc mld files}

[md2mld] converts a Markdown-format file into the [mld] format used by {{: https://github.com/ocaml/odoc} odoc} to render HTML documentation or OCaml libraries.  You can use this script to automatically embed a [README.md] file into API documentation for an OCaml  library.

{1 Usage}

You can use it manually as follows

{@console[
$ md2mld filename.md > outfile.mld
]}

In [dune] you can use it to generate an mld file with

{@text[
(rule
 (target outfile.mld)
 (deps filename.md)
 (action
  (with-stdout-to outfile.mld (run md2mld filename.md))))
]}

Attach the mld file using the {{: https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/documentation.html#documentation-stanza-examples} [(documentation â€¦)] stanza}.
You can see the documentation generated from the latest tagged version of this README at {{: https://mseri.github.io/md2mld/md2mld} mseri.github.io/md2mld/md2mld}.

{1 Known issues}
{ul {- 

Until the new odoc {{: https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/issues/141} fixing #141} is released, the minimal header allowed in the [md] file will be the level 3 one [###].
You can work around this by using the [-min-header 3] flag during the invocation of [md2mld].
}{- 

If you see an error like ['{0': heading level should be lower than top heading level '0'], this is because in [ocamldoc] the first header must have a level higher than all other headings in the page.
You can safely ignore it or increase the level of the subsequent headings to get rid of it.
